# <p align="center"> <b>Krowism</b> </p>
Krowism is a basic Discord.js v13 bot that explores SlashCommands, Database Integrations, Ko-Fi WebHook, and Welcome/Join Messages. As Discod.js v14 is now released,
a majority of these features and functions within this upload are deprecated.

Therefore, as a majority of these functions and features within this Repo are considered deprecated and/or generally outdated, I will be merging and focusing on a
new Discord.js v14 project. As such, this repo is posted for achive purposes **as is**
